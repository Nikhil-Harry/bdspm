                        and concentration of a student. It doesn’t matter what kind of sports the students are 
                        playing and whether they are winning or not. Every sport will always inculcate some amazing

                        The first responsibility of an institution is to remove the stage fear of the students. The students should be able to speak fluently in any big stage without fearing the consequences of their limitations with regard to their oratory skills. It is the basic necessity for the students to speak well. On the other hand, the students should also be taught the importance of writing on their own without making any grammatical errors. After learning the essence of these skills, the college students must be allowed to express themselves without any inhibitions.
                        <br><br>
                        Our Institute also understands the importance of Extra Curricular activities amongst college going students and that is why we conduct the following extra curricular activities for students every year:
                        <br><br>
                        <span style="color:#222; margin-right: 2px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">✍︎</span> 
                        Every year writing and debate competitions are organized in which all the students test themselves on the intellectual level.
                        <br><br>
                        <span style="color:#222; margin-right: 2px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">✍︎</span> 
                        Cultural programs, seminars and meetings are organized from time to time.
                        <br><br>
                        <span style="color:#222; margin-right: 2px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">✍︎</span> 
                        Tree plantation is organized twice a year on a large scale.
                        <br><br>
                        <span style="color:#222; margin-right: 2px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">✍︎</span> 
                        Sanskrit Sambhavshan Kendra has also been opened in the college on behalf of Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, so that every Sanskrit loving student/students can be benefitted.
